## Introduction
[↑ Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

From product they ask us to create a letter or menu of a digital restaurant, in this case to put into practice the knowledge acquired in terms of HTML5, CSS3, CSS Layout (Flexbox & Grid) in addition to Bootstrap.

The minimum requirements will consist of three hyperlinked html pages, the minimum essential being Home (Introduction of the establishment), Contact (contact) and Card or menu.

The theme (type of establishment) is free in this case, as long as it is a restaurant establishment.

Special attention will be paid to design and visual cleanliness.

In this case the project will be carried out individually.

## Description

Taking into account the requirements, we came to the conclusion that this would be the minimum of convenient views:

- View Home / Main / Presentation of the establishment.
- Contact view.
- Card view.

The final result is that the following pages have been created:
- Home page
- Page about the history of the establishment
- Menu divided by product type.
- Specific page for each type of products
- And of course a page with a contact form.

## Technologies

For the development of the frontend, HTML5 + CSS Layout will be used with the recommended possibility of adding Bootstrap.

The responsive adaptation capacity of the application will be especially valued.

The project will be uploaded to a public GitHub repository.

It will be an essential requirement that the repository(s) have a complete Readme and a varied number of commits as well as these being as readable as possible.
